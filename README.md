# COMP9517 Group Project for team Frog

This is the github for our groups' code, report and files (note that the image databases should not be included since they're too big).  

Task allocation will probably be written here (in the readme) for easy refrence.  

The data folder structure should look exactly like this for consistency between us (obviously open to improvement suggestions).
